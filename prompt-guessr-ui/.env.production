# Frontend Production Environment Variables (Public)
# These values are baked into the Next.js build at build time
# DO NOT include secrets here - these are exposed to the browser

# Backend API endpoints (will be set by Amplify environment variables)
# Set in AWS Amplify Console → Environment variables
# Example values shown below:

# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://your-ec2-public-ip:3001
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=http://your-ec2-public-ip:3001

# Note: These should be configured in AWS Amplify Console, not in this file
# This file exists as documentation of required variables
